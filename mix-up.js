Mix Up

Create a function called mixUp. It should take in two strings, and return
the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and
swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are
at least 2 characters long. For example:

  mixUp('mix', pod'): 'pox mid'
  mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
